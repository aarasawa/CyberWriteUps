# Flag Command - Very Easy

### Description
> Embark on the "Dimensional Escape Quest" where you wake up in a mysterious forest maze that's not quite of this world. Navigate singing squirrels, mischievous nymphs, and grumpy wizards in a whimsical labyrinth that may lead to otherworldly surprises. Will you conquer the enchanted maze or find yourself lost in a different dimension of magical challenges? The journey unfolds in this mystical escape!

> The challenge has a Zork-like text based game where you type commands into the terminal and the game progresses. This one took a while to think about because I have not done any web exploitation challenges besides SQL injection and robots.txt checking. Thankfully, I have some experience working with Postman and checking hidden paths on websites. Thats all that was needed to acquire the flag for this challenge.
