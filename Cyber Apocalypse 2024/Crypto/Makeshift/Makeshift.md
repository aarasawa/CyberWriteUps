# Makeshift - Very Easy

### Description
> Weak and starved, you struggle to plod on. Food is a commodity at this stage, but you canâ€™t lose your alertness - to do so would spell death. You realise that to survive you will need a weapon, both to kill and to hunt, but the field is bare of stones. As you drop your body to the floor, something sharp sticks out of the undergrowth and into your thigh. As you grab a hold and pull it out, you realise itâ€™s a long stick; not the finest of weapons, but once sharpened could be the difference between dying of hunger and dying with honour in combat.

### 1. 
> An encrypted string that I assume to be the flag and a python script were provided. I believe that reversing the encryption algo in the python script would yield the flag. I did not include the python script they provided, just my solution. 

### 2.
> Characters in the encrypted string were reveresed then scrambled in intervals of 3 characters at a time. I just reversed this and got the flag.
