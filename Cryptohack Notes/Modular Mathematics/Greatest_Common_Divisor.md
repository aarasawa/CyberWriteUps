# Greatest Common Divisor

#### Summary
The GCD or highest common factor is the largest number that divides two positive integers. 
<ul>
  <li>Two integers are <code>coprime</code> if the GCD(a, b) == 1</li>
  <li>If a and b are prime, then they are also coprime</li>
  <li>If a is prime and b < a, then a and b are coprime</li>
</ul>
If b > a, a and b are not guaranteed coprime because a could potentially be a factor of b. If a were prime, then it guarantees that everything from 2 < x < a is not a factor of a.
