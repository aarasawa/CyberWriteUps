# Character Encoding - Easy

### 1. 
> We are provided with an array of numbers that appear to be hexadecimal. \
> 41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D

### 2. 
> Character encoding and working with different number systems is something that I have some
> familiarity with. So given the array of numbers I decided to write a python script to parse
> and convert it into decimal. 

### Solution
> Coverting to decimal did the trick.
