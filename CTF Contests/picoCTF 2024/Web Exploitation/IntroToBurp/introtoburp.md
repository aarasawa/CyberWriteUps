> A website with a registration form is presented to the user and based on the title, I am going to try to use BurpSuite and analyze the requests. It took a while of playing around with BurpSuite to alter the requests to get the flag. I don't want to spoil it, but also the challenge is very oddly strucutred. I am not sure what they wanted us to learn from it since I do not know if the method I used is a normal exploit technique.
