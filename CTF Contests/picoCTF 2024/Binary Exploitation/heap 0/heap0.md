#### Description
> Are overflows just a stack concern?

#### 1. 
> The same feel as a buffer overflow, using a sufficiently long string would allow you to overwrite the safe variable that allows you to print the flag. Created a really ugly script to get the flag, did not want to spend too much optimizing it because it only takes 3 interactions to get the flag.
