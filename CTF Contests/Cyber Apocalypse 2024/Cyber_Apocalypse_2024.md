# Cyber Apocalypse 2024 + Afterparty

> ## This is the my first time participating in a CTF event there were multiple categories, however, I have not worked on the other types of CTFs to work on them. I have the most experience in general cryptography and simple web application exploits. Including 1 misc challenge which just involved a tutorial and interacting with a netcat server to get the flag. Attempting to solve up some of the challenges I was stumped by during the event. Then look ahead at medium and hard writeups to learn a few things. A lot of my answers or scripts are much more clunky than they need to be. Some of the ones I needed help solving used some tools I've never heard of like sqlmap, hashcat, burpsuite, etc.
